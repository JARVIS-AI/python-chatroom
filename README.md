# Python Chatroom - Socket

# Description: 
This chatroom is written in Python using sockets and threading.

# Why?

This project was inspired by a mistake I made at work. I initially wrote poorly structured code, 
but luckily, a friend came to my rescue.

# Requirements

* Python 3.12.2 (or later)
* Terminal (WSL / Powershell)

# Thanks

A big thank you to:

1. Socket package developers
2. Hamid (Mr. Hidden)
3. Rishija for the idea
4. Microsoft (VS Code)
5. JetBrains (PyCharm)
6. And everyone else who has helped!
